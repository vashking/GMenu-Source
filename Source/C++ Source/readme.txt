GMenu open source (asi version) created as a platform for the development of your software
In folder 'Launcher' you will find files for the launcher of the mobile version and the pc version
In folder 'Content' files for edit or development of your software on a full basis. The developer will not help you in any way with developing your software from the word at all. The sources are created exclusively for personal development.
Libraries for normal software operation, lol

(if there are no files, then I have not yet uploaded the current version)
